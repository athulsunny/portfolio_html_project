<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>With a Bachelor's degree in Naval Architecture and one year of experience in
  ship production and design, I have gained significant knowledge and expertise in the marine
  industry.</p>
  <p>I am currently pursuing a BS in Data Science and Applications from IIT Madras, with a focus
  on statistical analysis, data collection and processing, and data visualization and
  presentation. My coursework has equipped me with a strong foundation in analytical skills
  and tools such as Python, SQL, R, and Tableau. I have also completed a professional
  certificate in Google Data Analytics and gained expertise in analytical tools such as Jupyter
  Notebook and Excel. I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Data Science course offered
  by iNeuron, where I am learning to work with libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and
  Matplotlib.</p>
  <p>My project on predictive maintenance for naval vessel condition showcases my ability to
  develop a linear regression model using Python to predict the condition of naval vessel
  machinery based on vibration measurements. I achieved a mean squared error of 0.027 and
  an R-squared value of 0.9 on the test set, which can have significant implications for the
  naval industry, where machinery failures can be costly and dangerous. As a project
  engineer at Synergy Ship Builders, I supervised the overall production activities of ships in
  the yard, including a 20-meter catamaran and a 19-meter tugboat. In my previous role as a
  naval architect at Boatcraft Services Pvt Ltd, I created 2D and 3D designs and conducted
  stability and performance testing of speedboats</p>
